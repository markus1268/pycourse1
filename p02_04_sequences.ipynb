    "### Exercise 2.4e: Inverting a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary maps keys to values. For example, a dictionary of stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> prices = {\n",
    "        'GOOG' : 490.1,\n",
    "        'AA' : 23.45,\n",
    "        'IBM' : 91.1,\n",
    "        'MSFT' : 34.23\n",
    "    }\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use the `items()` method, you can get `(key,value)` pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> prices.items()\n",
    "dict_items([('GOOG', 490.1), ('AA', 23.45), ('IBM', 91.1), ('MSFT', 34.23)])\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if you wanted to get a list of `(value, key)` pairs instead?\n",
    "*Hint: use `zip()`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> pricelist = list(zip(prices.values(),prices.keys()))\n",
    ">>> pricelist\n",
    "[(490.1, 'GOOG'), (23.45, 'AA'), (91.1, 'IBM'), (34.23, 'MSFT')]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you do this? For one, it allows you to perform certain kinds\n",
    "of data processing on the dictionary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> min(pricelist)\n",
    "(23.45, 'AA')\n",
    ">>> max(pricelist)\n",
    "(490.1, 'GOOG')\n",
    ">>> sorted(pricelist)\n",
    "[(23.45, 'AA'), (34.23, 'MSFT'), (91.1, 'IBM'), (490.1, 'GOOG')]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This also illustrates an important feature of tuples. When used in\n",
    "comparisons, tuples are compared element-by-element starting with the\n",
    "first item. Similar to how strings are compared\n",
    "character-by-character.\n",
    "\n",
    "`zip()` is often used in situations like this where you need to pair\n",
    "up data from different places.  For example, pairing up the column\n",
    "names with column values in order to make a dictionary of named\n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `zip()` is not limited to pairs. For example, you can use it\n",
    "with any number of input lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    ">>> b = ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z']\n",
    ">>> c = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]\n",
    ">>> list(zip(a, b, c))\n",
    "[(1, 'w', 0.2), (2, 'x', 0.4), (3, 'y', 0.6), (4, 'z', 0.8))]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, be aware that `zip()` stops once the shortest input sequence is exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    ">>> b = ['x', 'y', 'z']\n",
    ">>> list(zip(a,b))\n",
    "[(1, 'x'), (2, 'y'), (3, 'z')]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```"
